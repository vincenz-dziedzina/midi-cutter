This is an attempt to use portmidi on Mono.

Looks like portmidi project itself is trying to support managed
solution, but it looks bogus since it seems trying to use C++/CLI
mixed solution which is no-go for Mono.


You need shared library version of portmidi, which can be built
with some help of my patches. See portmidi-patches directory as
well as README in the patch directory.
